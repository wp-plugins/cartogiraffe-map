== Description ==

Cartogiraffe.com is a new map based on Openstreetmap. You can use it as standard map, bicycle map, transport map or hiking map.

The bicycle map contains cycleways, cyclepaths and routes.
The transport map contains trains, trams, buses and so on with stations.
The hiking map contains hiking-friendly paths - both in cities and in nature.

Use the shortcode-generator in the article-edit-mode to create shortcodes. You can display as many maps as you need within your article.
